## 🧠 Agentic RAG Pipeline with LlamaIndex & Ollama

This project is a fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to interact with a custom collection of PDF documents. It uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to run the `phi3:mini` model for LLM inference, Hugging Face embeddings for semantic search, and Streamlit for a responsive chat interface. Built for privacy, speed, and modularity—no cloud APIs required.

---

### 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Semantic search across multiple PDFs using Hugging Face embeddings  
- 🧠 Local LLM inference with Ollama (`phi3:mini`)  
- 💬 Streamlit-powered chat interface for real-time Q&A  
- 📄 Custom document corpus (PDFs stored in `/data`)  
- 🔐 Fully offline and privacy-preserving architecture

| Component       | Tool/Model                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| LLM             | Ollama (`phi3:mini`)              |
| Embeddings      | Hugging Face (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`) |
| Framework       | LlamaIndex                        |
| UI              | Streamlit                         |
| Data            | Custom PDFs (`./data/`)           |

### 📦 Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**  
   *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, generate it with `pipreqs .`)*  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start Ollama**  
   Make sure Ollama is installed and the model is pulled:
   ```bash
   ollama run phi3:mini
   ```

3. **Launch the app**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run chat_app.py
   ```

---

### 🧠 How It Works

- PDFs are loaded and chunked using LlamaIndex  
- Embeddings are generated via Hugging Face and stored in a vector index  
- User queries are matched against relevant chunks  
- Responses are generated by `phi3:mini` running locally via Ollama
